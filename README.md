### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mohammed. I'm a Front-End Web Developer and Problem Solver with experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

Through my 10+ years of experience at multinational engineering companies, I have developed five essential skills that will stick with me for the rest of my life. Discipline, leadership, being able to work with a team, hard work, and attention to detail.

I would love to connect. Please shoot me a message if you'd like to network.
